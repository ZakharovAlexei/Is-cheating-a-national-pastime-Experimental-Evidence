Raymond Duch, Denise Laroze and Alexei Zakharov (alphabetical order)

We examine the notion that cheating or corrupt behavior varies significantly across diverse national contexts (Britain, Chile, and Russia).  We conduct tax compliance experiments in which subjects earn real money, are subject to a tax, and can lie about their earnings.  Performing better on incentivized real effort tasks results in more cheating.  High performance types give less in a conventional Dictator Game and also cheat more in a classic die game in which they privately report the results of tossing a die. This replicates the findings of \citet{DuchSolaz2016}. Moreover, cheating by high performance types knows no national, economic or cultural boundaries.

This repository includes replication code for experimental sessions and data analysis for the manuscript titled “Is Cheating a National Pastime? Experimental Evidence”. 


Experimental sessions include:
 - Santiago 2015 MT - Baseline	
 - Santiago 2015 MT - Shock	
 - Santiago 2015 MT - Status	
 - Santiago 2016 MT - Non-Fixed
 - Dice images used for the virtual die in the Non-Fixed treatment
